                  method for the fully automatic analysis of short echo time in
                  vivo (1)H Magnetic resonance spectroscopy is presented.
                  Analysis is performed in the time domain using non-negative
                  least squares, and a new method for applying soft constraints
                  to signal amplitudes is used to improve fitting stability.
                  Initial point truncation and Hankel singular value
                  decomposition water removal are used to reduce baseline
                  interference. Three methods were used to test performance.
                  First, metabolite concentrations from six healthy volunteers
                  at 3 T were compared with LCModel. Second, a Monte-Carlo
                  simulation was performed and results were compared with
                  LCModel to test the accuracy of the new method. Finally, the
                  new algorithm was applied to 1956 spectra, acquired clinically
                  at 1.5 T, to test robustness to noisy, abnormal, artifactual,
                  and poorly shimmed spectra. Discrepancies of less than
                  approximately 20\% were found between the main metabolite
                  concentrations determined by TARQUIN and LCModel from healthy
                  volunteer data. The Monte-Carlo simulation revealed that
                  errors in metabolite concentration estimates were comparable
                  with LCModel. TARQUIN analyses were also found to be robust to
                  clinical data of variable quality. In conclusion, TARQUIN has
                  been shown to be an accurate and robust algorithm for the
                  analysis of magnetic resonance spectroscopy data making it
                  suitable for use in a clinical setting.},

  abstract =     {Proton MRS ((1) H MRS) provides noninvasive, quantitative
                  metabolite profiles of tissue and has been shown to aid the
                  clinical management of several brain diseases. Although most
                  modern clinical MR scanners support MRS capabilities, routine
                  use is largely restricted to specialized centers with good
                  access to MR research support. Widespread adoption has been
                  slow for several reasons, and technical challenges toward
                  obtaining reliable good-quality results have been identified
                  as a contributing factor. Considerable progress has been made
                  by the research community to address many of these challenges,
                  and in this paper a consensus is presented on deficiencies in
                  widely available MRS methodology and validated improvements
                  that are currently in routine use at several clinical research
                  institutions. In particular, the localization error for the
                  PRESS localization sequence was found to be unacceptably high
                  at 3 T, and use of the semi-adiabatic localization by
                  adiabatic selective refocusing sequence is a recommended
                  solution. Incorporation of simulated metabolite basis sets
                  into analysis routines is recommended for reliably capturing
                  the full spectral detail available from short TE acquisitions.
                  In addition, the importance of achieving a highly homogenous
                  static magnetic field (B0 ) in the acquisition region is
                  emphasized, and the limitations of current methods and
                  hardware are discussed. Most recommendations require only
                  software improvements, greatly enhancing the capabilities of
                  clinical MRS on existing hardware. Implementation of these
                  recommendations should strengthen current clinical
                  applications and advance progress toward developing and
                  validating new MRS biomarkers for clinical use.},

                  is known, that of the macromolecules is only partially known.
                  We present time-domain semi-parametric estimation approaches
                  based on the QUEST quantitation algorithm (QUantitation based
                  on QUantum ESTimation) and encompassing Cramer-Rao bounds that
                  handle the influence of 'nuisance' parameters related to the
                  background. Three novel methods for background accommodation
                  are presented. They are based on the fast decay of the
                  background signal in the time domain. After automatic
                  estimation, the background signal can be automatically (1)
                  subtracted from the raw data, (2) included in the basis set as
                  multiple components, or (3) included in the basis set as a
                  single entity. The performances of these methods combined with
                  QUEST are evaluated through extensive Monte Carlo studies.
                  They are compared in terms of bias-variance trade-off. Because
                  error bars on the amplitudes are of paramount importance for
                  diagnostic reliability, Cramer-Rao bounds accounting for the
                  uncertainty caused by the background are proposed.

                  sensitivity and specificity for the quantification of GSH
                  concentrations without editing at short TE. The approach was
                  to measure synthetically generated changes in GSH
                  concentrations from in vivo stimulated echo acquisition mode
                  (STEAM) spectra after in vitro GSH spectra had been added to
                  or subtracted from them. Spectra from five test subjects were
                  synthetically altered to mimic changes in the GSH signal. To
                  account for different background noise between measurements,
                  retest spectra (from the same individuals as used to generate
                  the altered data) and spectra from five other individuals were
                  compared with the synthetically altered spectra to investigate
                  the reliability of the quantification of GSH concentration.
                  Using STEAM spectroscopy at 7 T, GSH concentration differences
                  on the order of 20\% were detected between test and retest
                  studies, as well as between differing populations in a small
                  sample (n = 5) with high accuracy (R(2) &gt; 0.99) and
                  certainty (p &lt;/= 0.01). Both increases and decreases in GSH
                  concentration were reliably quantified with small impact on
                  the quantification of ascorbate and gamma-aminobutyric acid.
                  These results show the feasibility of using short-TE (1)H MRS
                  to measure biologically relevant changes and differences in
                  human brain GSH concentration. Although these outcomes are
                  specific to the experimental approach used and the spectral
                  quality achieved, this study serves as a template for the
                  analogous scrutiny of quantification reliability for other

                  editing. Taking advantage of increased sensitivity and
                  chemical shift dispersion at 7 T, Asc was quantified with
                  increased reliability relative to our previous study
                  accomplished at 4 T. Asc concentration quantified from
                  short-echo time spectra measured from the occipital lobe of
                  eight healthy subjects ([Asc] = 1.1 +/- 0.3 micromol/g, mean
                  +/- SD) was in excellent agreement with Asc concentration
                  quantified from the same volume of interest using homonuclear
                  editing ([Asc] = 1.2 +/- 0.2 micromol/g). This agreement
                  indicates that at 7 T, Asc can be reliably quantified in the
                  human brain simultaneously with 15 other metabolites.
                  Additional advantages of the short-echo time approach were:
                  shorter measurement time than homonuclear editing and minimal
                  effect of T(2) relaxation on Asc quantification. High magnetic
                  field was also beneficial for Asc quantification with
                  MEGA-PRESS because increased chemical shift dispersion enabled
                  editing with full efficiency, which resulted in a supra-linear
                  gain in signal-to-noise ratio relative to 4 T.},

                  from those of metabolites, such as shorter T1 and T2

                  investigated with a focus on adults over 66 years of age using
                  ultrahigh-field in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
                  Eighteen young and 23 cognitively normal older adults were
                  studied at 7 T. Metabolite spectra were acquired in the
                  occipital cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex with
                  single-voxel stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM)
                  spectroscopy in 14 young and 20 older adults. Macromolecular
                  spectra were acquired in the occipital cortex using an
                  inversion recovery STEAM sequence in four young and three
                  older adults. The macromolecular pattern was apparent over the
                  0.5-4.5-ppm range in the inversion recovery spectra and the
                  0.5-2-ppm range in the metabolite spectra. Macromolecular
                  content was quantified from metabolite spectra using LCModel
                  and from inversion recovery spectra using integration.
                  Age-associated differences in the macromolecular pattern were
                  apparent via both types of spectra, with the largest
                  difference observed for the 1.7- and 2-ppm macromolecular
                  resonances. A higher macromolecular content was observed in
                  the older adults for both brain regions. Age-specific
                  macromolecular spectra are needed when comparing metabolite
                  spectra from subjects of differing ages because of
                  age-associated differences in macromolecular pattern.
                  Age-associated pattern and content differences may provide
                  information about the aging process.},

                  investigated the accuracy and reproducibility of short-TE MRS
                  measurements of GABA at 3 T using both simulations and
                  experiments. LCModel analysis was performed on a large number
                  of simulated spectra with known metabolite input
                  concentrations. Simulated spectra were generated using a range
                  of spectral linewidths and signal-to-noise ratios to
                  investigate the effect of varying experimental conditions, and
                  analyses were performed using two different baseline models to
                  investigate the effect of an inaccurate baseline model on GABA
                  quantification. The results of these analyses indicated that,
                  under experimental conditions corresponding to those typically
                  observed in the occipital cortex, GABA concentration estimates
                  are reproducible (mean reproducibility error, &lt;20\%), even
                  when an incorrect baseline model is used. However, simulations
                  indicate that the accuracy of GABA concentration estimates
                  depends strongly on the experimental conditions (linewidth and
                  signal-to-noise ratio). In addition to simulations, in vivo
                  GABA measurements were performed using both spectral editing
                  and short-TE MRS in the occipital cortex of 14 healthy
                  volunteers. Short-TE MRS measurements of GABA exhibited a
                  significant positive correlation with edited GABA measurements
                  (R = 0.58, p &lt; 0.05), suggesting that short-TE measurements
                  of GABA correspond well with measurements made using spectral
                  editing techniques. Finally, within-session reproducibility
                  was assessed in the same 14 subjects using four consecutive
                  short-TE GABA measurements in the occipital cortex. Across all
                  subjects, the average coefficient of variation of these four
                  GABA measurements was 8.7 +/- 4.9\%. This study demonstrates
                  that, under some experimental conditions, short-TE MRS can be
                  employed for the reproducible detection of GABA at 3 T, but
                  that the technique should be used with caution, as the results
                  are dependent on the experimental conditions.},

                  measured macromolecules and spline baseline on the
                  quantification results of proton MRS data was investigated.
                  METHODS: Proton MRS spectra from the left parietal lobe and
                  the occipital lobe were acquired at 9.4T in the human brain
                  using metabolite-cycled semi-LASER. Then, the left parietal
                  lobe data, along with the occipital lobe, spectra were
                  quantified and the influence of the inclusion of
                  experimentally measured macromolecular basis sets in the
                  fitting model was evaluated. Furthermore, the effect of the
                  stiffness of the fitted spline baselines on the resulting
                  metabolite concentrations was evaluated. RESULTS: In general,
                  concentrations were higher for metabolites in occipital lobe
                  than the left parietal lobe. The inclusion of an
                  experimentally acquired measured macromolecular basis set from
                  another brain region neither affected the quantification
                  results nor the resulting spline baselines significantly. A
                  highly flexible spline baseline led to overestimation or
                  underestimation of metabolite concentrations. Differences of
                  above 15\% in the quantification of metabolite levels for both
                  lobes were observed for several metabolites using LCModel
                  default settings for spline baselines and macromolecules in
                  comparison to stiffer spline baselines. CONCLUSION: Fitting
                  with the default LCModel macromolecular basis set and spline
                  baseline model had significant influence in the resulting
                  spline baselines, leading to large deviations both in the
                  concentrations and fitted macromolecular components. The
                  number of knots in the spline may create overflexible
                  baselines, which can potentially lead to quantification
                  errors. Interestingly, the interchange of macromolecular basis
                  set between occipital lobe and left parietal lobe spectra had
                  less influence on the quantification results compared to the
                  default LCModel settings.},

                  Reliable 2-HG quantitation requires reproducible
                  post-processing, deployment of fitting algorithms and
                  quantitation methods. We prospectively enrolled 38 patients
                  with suspected or recently diagnosed gliomas (IDH mutated n =
                  26). The MRI protocol included a (1) H single voxel PRESS
                  sequence with volumes of usually 8 mL or more (20 x 20 x 20
                  mm(3) ) at TE = 97 ms and 180 degrees pulse spacing. Our aim
                  was to evaluate the reliability of 2-HG quantitation comparing
                  two frequently used software tools and their respective
                  options of baseline correction (jMRUI with the time domain
                  methods AQSES and QUEST, and LCModel, which analyzes the
                  frequency domain data). For AQSES, degrees of freedom for
                  baseline correction constrains were varied. For LCModel,
                  baseline correction was obtained with and without correction
                  of the unknown background term (predefined macromolecules,
                  lipids). Tissue concentrations were calculated based on the
                  phantom replacement method. Quantitation of 2-HG levels showed
                  similar mean 2-HG tissue concentrations for IDH mutated tumors
                  (2.65mM, range 3.06-2.20) for all methods. Bland-Altman plots
                  (difference plots) did not reveal a systematic bias (fixed
                  bias) for any of the algorithms tested, and we were able to
                  show a significant correlation regarding 2-HG concentration at
                  the same echo time with few statistical outliers (parametric
                  correlation). However, evaluation of outliers suggested that
                  in vivo quantitation of 2-HG is affected not only by the
                  fitting domain (time or frequency), but also by the baseline
                  correction, which is a major contributing factor to the result
                  of 2-HG fitting. Clinical application of 2-HG quantitation as
                  a prognostic or predictive biomarker, particularly in
                  multicenter trials, requires standardized use of fitting
                  methods and baseline correction procedures.},

                  be fundamental to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, and
                  the glutamatergic system is a target for novel therapeutic
                  interventions in the disorder. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the
                  nature of brain glutamate alterations in schizophrenia by
                  conducting a meta-analysis of glutamate proton magnetic
                  resonance (MRS) spectroscopy studies. DATA SOURCES: The
                  MEDLINE database was searched for studies published from
                  January 1, 1980, to April 1, 2015. Search terms included
                  magnetic resonance spectroscopy, schizophrenia, psychosis,
                  clinical or genetic high risk, and schizoaffective. Inclusion
                  criteria were single voxel 1H-MRS studies reporting glutamate,
                  glutamine or Glx values for a patient or risk group in
                  comparison to a healthy volunteer group. STUDY SELECTION:
                  Fifty-nine studies were identified, which included 1686
                  patients and 1451 healthy individuals serving as controls.
                  DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: A random-effects,
                  inverse-weighted variance model was used to calculate the
                  pooled effect size. Mean values were extracted and verified
                  independently. Effect sizes were determined for glutamate,
                  glutamine, and Glx in brain regions that had been examined in
                  at least 3 different studies. A secondary analysis grouped
                  studies into those examining patients at different stages of
                  illness (high risk, first-episode psychosis, or chronic
                  schizophrenia). Effects of age, antipsychotic dose, and
                  symptom severity were determined using meta-regression.
                  RESULTS: In schizophrenia, there were significant elevations
                  in glutamate in the basal ganglia (Hedges g = 0.63; 95\% CI,
                  0.15-1.11), glutamine in the thalamus (g = 0.56; 95\% CI,
                  0.02-1.09), and Glx in the basal ganglia (g = 0.39; 95\% CI,
                  0.09-0.70) and medial temporal lobe (g = 0.32; 95\% CI,
                  0.12-0.52). No region showed a reduction in glutamate
                  metabolites in schizophrenia. Secondary analyses revealed that
                  elevated medial frontal Glx levels were evident in individuals
                  at high risk for schizophrenia (g = 0.26; 95\% CI, 0.05-0.46)
                  but not in those with first-episode psychosis or chronic
                  schizophrenia, whereas elevated Glx in the medial temporal
                  lobe was seen with chronic schizophrenia (g = 0.40; 95\% CI,
                  0.08-0.71) but not in the high-risk or first-episode groups.
                  Meta-regression found no association with age, symptom
                  severity, or antipsychotic dose. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:
                  Schizophrenia is associated with elevations in glutamatergic
                  metabolites across several brain regions. This finding
                  supports the hypothesis that schizophrenia is associated with
                  excess glutamatergic neurotransmission in several limbic areas
                  and further indicates that compounds that reduce glutamatergic
                  transmission may have therapeutic potential.},

                  (1)H MR spectroscopy in the clinical evaluation of disorders
                  of the central nervous system. The clinical usefulness of (1)H

                  disorders, and infectious brain lesions. The growing list of
                  disorders for which (1)H MR spectroscopy may contribute to
                  patient management extends to neurodegenerative diseases,
                  epilepsy, and stroke. To facilitate expanded clinical

  abstract =     {BACKGROUND: In neonatal encephalopathy, the clinical
                  manifestations of injury can only be reliably assessed several
                  years after an intervention, complicating early
                  prognostication and rendering trials of promising
                  neuroprotectants slow and expensive. We aimed to determine the
                  accuracy of thalamic proton magnetic resonance (MR)
                  spectroscopy (MRS) biomarkers as early predictors of the
                  neurodevelopmental abnormalities observed years after neonatal
                  encephalopathy. METHODS: We did a prospective multicentre
                  cohort study across eight neonatal intensive care units in the
                  UK and USA, recruiting term and near-term neonates who
                  received therapeutic hypothermia for neonatal encephalopathy.
                  We excluded infants with life-threatening congenital
                  malformations, syndromic disorders, neurometabolic diseases,
                  or any alternative diagnoses for encephalopathy that were
                  apparent within 6 h of birth. We obtained T1-weighted,
                  T2-weighted, and diffusion-weighted MRI and thalamic proton
                  MRS 4-14 days after birth. Clinical neurodevelopmental tests
                  were done 18-24 months later. The primary outcome was the
                  association between MR biomarkers and an adverse
                  neurodevelopmental outcome, defined as death or moderate or
                  severe disability, measured using a multivariable prognostic
                  model. We used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves
                  to examine the prognostic accuracy of the individual
                  biomarkers. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,
                  number NCT01309711. FINDINGS: Between Jan 29, 2013, and June
                  25, 2016, we recruited 223 infants who all underwent MRI and
                  MRS at a median age of 7 days (IQR 5-10), with 190 (85\%)
                  followed up for neurological examination at a median age of 23
                  months (20-25). Of those followed up, 31 (16\%) had moderate
                  or severe disability, including one death. Multiple logistic
                  regression analysis could not be done because thalamic
                  N-acetylaspartate (NAA) concentration alone accurately
                  predicted an adverse neurodevelopmental outcome (area under
                  the curve [AUC] of 0.99 [95\% CI 0.94-1.00]; sensitivity 100\%
                  [74-100]; specificity 97\% [90-100]; n=82); the models would
                  not converge when any additional variable was examined. The
                  AUC (95\% CI) of clinical examination at 6 h (n=190) and at
                  discharge (n=167) were 0.72 (0.65-0.78) and 0.60 (0.53-0.68),
                  respectively, and the AUC of abnormal amplitude integrated EEG
                  at 6 h (n=169) was 0.73 (0.65-0.79). On conventional MRI
                  (n=190), cortical injury had an AUC of 0.67 (0.60-0.73), basal
                  ganglia or thalamic injury had an AUC of 0.81 (0.75-0.87), and
                  abnormal signal in the posterior limb of internal capsule
                  (PLIC) had an AUC of 0.82 (0.76-0.87). Fractional anisotropy
                  of PLIC (n=65) had an AUC of 0.82 (0.76-0.87). MRS metabolite
                  peak-area ratios (n=160) of NAA-creatine (&lt;1.29) had an AUC
                  of 0.79 (0.72-0.85), of NAA-choline had an AUC of 0.74
                  (0.66-0.80), and of lactate-NAA (&gt;0.22) had an AUC of 0.94
                  (0.89-0.97). INTERPRETATION: Thalamic proton MRS measures
                  acquired soon after birth in neonatal encephalopathy had the
                  highest accuracy to predict neurdevelopment 2 years later.
                  These methods could be applied to increase the power of
                  neuroprotection trials while reducing their duration. FUNDING:

                  scans for dynamic measurement of a range of brain metabolites

                  used to assess the dynamic metabolic responses of the brain to

                  information on the dynamic functional response of
                  gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the primary inhibitory
                  neurotransmitter in the brain, is available. We aimed to
                  measure the activation-induced changes in GABA unambiguously
                  using a spectral editing method, instead of the conventional
                  direct detection techniques used in previous fMRS studies. The
                  Mescher-Garwood-semi-localised by adiabatic selective
                  refocusing (MEGA-sLASER) sequence was developed at 7T to
                  obtain the time course of GABA concentration without
                  macromolecular contamination. A significant decrease
                  (-12+/-5\%) in the GABA to total creatine ratio (GABA/tCr) was
                  observed in the motor cortex during a period of 10min of
                  hand-clenching, compared to an initial baseline level
                  (GABA/tCr =0.11+/-0.02) at rest. An increase in the Glx
                  (glutamate and glutamine) to tCr ratio was also found, which
                  is in agreement with previous findings. In contrast, no
                  significant changes in NAA/tCr and tCr were detected. With
                  consistent and highly efficient editing performance for GABA
                  detection and the advantage of visually identifying GABA
                  resonances in the spectra, MEGA-sLASER is demonstrated to be
                  an effective method for studying of dynamic changes in GABA at

                  goal of 1H MRS is the reliable quantification of
                  concentrations of metabolites (neurochemical profile) in a
                  well-defined region of the brain. The availability of very
                  high magnetic field strengths combined with the possibility of
                  acquiring spectra at very short echo time have dramatically
                  increased the number of constituents of the neurochemical
                  profile. The quantification of spectra measured at short echo
                  times is complicated by the presence of macromolecule signals
                  of particular importance at high magnetic fields. An error in
                  the macromolecule estimation can lead to substantial errors in
                  the obtained neurochemical profile. The purpose of the present

                  focus on the metabolite quantification, in particular in
                  handling signals of macromolecules. Three main approaches of

                  mathematical estimation of macromolecules, measurement of
                  macromolecules in vivo, and direct acquisition of the in vivo
                  spectrum without the contribution of macromolecules.},
